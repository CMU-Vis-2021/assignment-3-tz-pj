    <h3>Who Becomes an Inventor?</h3>
    <h4>Innovation Rates by Childhood State and Gender</h4>
    <h5>By Tammy Zhou and Priya Jain, Oct 2021</h5>
    <p>The visualization shows patenting outcomes for children born in 1980-1984 by state in which they grew up, gender, and parent income.
        A child is defined as an inventor if he or she is listed on a patent application between 2001 and 2012 or grant between 1996 and 2014, and as a highly-cited inventor if he or she is among the 5% of inventors with the most patent citations by 2014 within his birth cohort. 
        Each child is assigned a state based on ZIP code from which his or her parents filed their 1040 tax return in the year the child was first claimed as a dependent.
        (Innovation rates are calcualted by number of inventors / number of children born)
